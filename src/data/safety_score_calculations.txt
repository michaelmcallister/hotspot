Motorbike hotspot risk calculations.

Safety score is based on crime statistics Victoria, statistics on motor vehicle thefts 
across Local Government Authorities (LGAs). The data gives us rates of motor vehicle 
thefts across Victoria, for each LGA and per 100,000 people population. Transport 
Victoria gives us data on the demographics of road users. The data allows us to see for 
each LGA, what proportion of vehicle drivers are motorbike riders. Multiplying this 
proportion by the number of motor vehicle thefts gives us an approximation on the 
number of motorbike thefts for each LGA across Victoria. 
The number that we get is a relative score. To improve readability, the number is then 
normalized between 0 and 1, with the lowest number being just above 0, and the 
highest being just below 1(epsilon = 1e-6).
Using a list of postcodes in each LGA across Victoria, the results are then expanded for 
each postcode within each LGA and in turn for each locality(suburb) within each LGA. 
Any suburbs that are unincorporated or belong to an LGA outside of Victoria are 
assigned the mean value for the state.
