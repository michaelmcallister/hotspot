# e2e - Developer documentation

Playwright is an automation library and framework that can be used to write tests against websites/webapps.

It is used in this project to help create tests that are aligned to our user journeys and the acceptance critiera and generate artefacts that we can upload to our PGP


## Setup

Just run `npm install` inside the e2e folder

## Generating artefacts

Simply run `npm run test` and you'll see artefacts in the "artefacts" directory, including PNGs and webm videos
